# Machine Learning

In this repo I post some things about Machine Learning written in Python - (could be anything related to ML). Even the most basic things are fascinating :smiley:

Folders:
* Activation Functions for Neural Network
* Ensemble Learning
* Dimensionality reduction
   - Principal Component Analysis
